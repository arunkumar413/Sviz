# Sviz
An SVG based free and open source visualization tool


## Running and testing the project:

   1) Download the project source code from https://github.com/arunkumar413/Online-EDA.git
   2) Unzip/extract the the contents of the downloaded zip file.
   3) cd to the project directory containing the files: home.html,parts.js.editor.js etc,.
   4) If you're using python 3.x version on your machine execute this code: `python -m http.server`
   5) If Python version is 2.X run: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
   6) Visit http://localhost:8000/home.html to access the application.
   7) By default, this will run the contents of the directory on a local web server, on port 8000.
   8) For more info on running a simple http server visit https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server

Note: If you already have something running on port 8000, you can choose another port by running the server command followed by an alternative port number, e.g. `python -m http.server 7800` (Python 3.x) or `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 7800` (Python 2.x). You can then access your content at localhost:7800.
